# Getting Started

## Installing Android Studio




# Fundamentals

* [Fragments](http://developer.android.com/guide/components/fragments.html) were introduced in [Honeycomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_Honeycomb)


## Visual Aspects

* sizing dimensions:
  * `dp` — (go-to) density-independent pixels; 1 dp = 1/160 th of the screen.
  * `sp` — (for text) dp's that are sensitive to user's scaling; all text should be in sp's.
  * `mm`, `pt`, `in` — useless as not all devices can scale these appropriately.
